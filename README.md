#DESCRIPTION

This project focuses on the implementation of an AI Chatbot using Natural Language Processing (NLP) techniques in Python with the help of the NLTK library. The aim of the chatbot is to simulate human-like conversations and respond intelligently to user queries.

The chatbot applies several NLP preprocessing techniques such as:

Tokenization – Splitting user input into individual words for analysis.

Lemmatization – Reducing words to their base form (e.g., studying → study).

Text normalization – Lowercasing and removing punctuation for consistency.

It uses a rule-based knowledge base, which contains predefined patterns and responses. For example, when a user types “hello”, the chatbot responds with a greeting. If the chatbot cannot understand the input, it provides a fallback response like “I’m not sure about that. Could you please rephrase?”. This ensures the chatbot can continue the conversation smoothly.

Features of the Chatbot:

Understands basic greetings, farewells, and simple questions.

Provides instant responses in an interactive console environment.

Uses NLP methods to process and understand text rather than just keyword matching.

Includes a loop mechanism so the conversation continues until the user decides to exit by typing "bye".

Lightweight and efficient, making it suitable as a beginner-friendly NLP project.

 Practical Applications:

Although simple, this chatbot demonstrates the core principles behind intelligent conversational agents such as:

Customer support systems

Virtual assistants (e.g., Siri, Alexa, Google Assistant)

FAQ bots for websites

Educational chatbots for learning assistance
